### Grading Policy

#### Weekly Badges

Each week we will cover a different topic. After succesfully completing assignments and quizzes for the topic, you will earn a Badge.

Each Badge will be graded as PASS/FAIL. You must pass all the the Badges to successfuly complete the course.

To PASS a badge, you must get 85% on the assignments and quizzes for the week. 

Scoring between 60%-85% is a SOFT-FAIL and you will be giving the oppurtunity to re-do the assignments for the week.

Scoring less than 60% is a HARD-FAIL and you must schedule time with a TA or mentor on the following week to try and catch up. The TA/mentor will work with you to find out what changes you need to make to improve. The TA/mentor may help you to develop a study schedule that will meet your goals. Or they might help you in finding the material you need. You should contact the TA/mentor by the Monday of the following week, and schedule a meeting with the TA/mentor by Wednesday.

#### Capstone Projects

At the end of the Pathway, you will create your own project using the skills you developed. For example, the Capstone Project for the first Pathways is a Personal/Profesional website. You will have one week to complete your project. When you are finished, you will present it.

The Capstone project also has a PASS/SOFT-FAIL/HARD-FAIL grade. They are in the form on interviews conducted by professional software developers. You will present your project to the interviewer. As you share your project, the interviewer will ask you questions about the development process, the code you wrote, and how you overcame difficulties along the way. Their goal is to help you express yourself and understand the process you went through. If you have done a good job on the project, they will be able to help you express that over the course of the interview. If you’ve had difficulties, they will be able to help you pinpoint them and help you adjust course. There’s no need to be nervous, but you do need to be prepared.
A SOFT-FAIL on the Capstone will mean you need to make adjustments to your project and try again.

A HARD-FAIL means you will have to go back and study. You will need to meet with a mentor to figure out ways you can course correct before trying again. You may have to re-do work on Badges, complete new assignments given by your mentor, or read/watch material from the Suggested Learning section.
